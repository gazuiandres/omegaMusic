# Omega music

Welcome to my litle music app project, I make this application to practice my skills in React and get fun with the process.

## How to use

1. Download the repository
2. cd omegaMusic
3. npm install && npm start
4. Enjoy the app 💙

## What I used to make it?

- I used React as core library and differents tools as React Context, hooks/custom hooks and React router for the views.

- I used styled-components library to avoid problems with classNames using CSS and make easy add styles to the components.

- Finally I used the library react-responsive to render different elements depending on screen size.
